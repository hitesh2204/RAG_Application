Background
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held in India, organized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). It is held annually since the first edition in 2008.[1] Kolkata Knight Riders were the defending champions, having won their third title in the previous season after beating Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.[2]

Format
Each team played twice against the teams in their group and the team in the same row in the other group, and once against the remaining four teams in the other group. After the group stage, the top four teams, based on aggregate points, would advance to the playoffs.[3] In this stage, the top two teams compete with each other (in a match titled "Qualifier 1"), as does the remaining two teams (in a match titled "Eliminator"). While the winner of Qualifier 1 would directly qualify for the final match, the losing team had another chance to qualify for the final match by competing against the winning team of the Eliminator (in a match titled "Qualifier 2"). The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2 match advanced to the final match.[4]

The IPL Governing Council decided to keep the number of matches to 74 for this edition as it was in the previous three seasons to help the cricketers balance their workload; however, it will be increased to 84 from 2026 onwards with the return of the double round-robin format.[5]

Rule changes
It was announced that the IPL will follow the International Cricket Council's (ICC) Code of Conduct regulations used for Twenty20 International (T20I) matches from 2025 onwards. The IPL had previously used its own Code of Conduct.[6]

Schedule
According to ESPNcricinfo, the dates of the tournament window for the three seasons between 2025 and 2027 were sent to franchises ahead of the 2025 auction.[7] In November 2024, the tentative dates for the three seasons were announced, with the 2025 edition set to take place from 14 March to 25 May.[8] In January 2025, it was announced that the 2025 season would commence on 21 March to allow for a two-week gap after the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final scheduled to take place on 9 March.[9] This led to a clash with the 2025 Pakistan Super League taking place from 11 April to 25 May 2025,[10] which was moved from its typical February–March window for the same reason.[11]

The first two matches were confirmed by the BCCI on 13 February 2025, with the inaugural match being hosted at the Eden Gardens between the defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru on 22 March.[12] The complete fixtures were announced on 16 February.[13] It was announced that both Qualifier 1 and Eliminator would be played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium on 20 and 21 May, and that Qualifier 2 and final would be played at the Eden Gardens on 23 and 25 May, with the venue to host its third IPL final after 2013 and 2015.[14]

Suspension and rescheduling
On 9 May 2025, the remaining matches were suspended due to the 2025 India–Pakistan crisis.[15] The revised schedule was announced on 12 May, with the remaining matches resumed on 17 May and were held across six venues.[16][17] On 20 May the playoff fixtures were confirmed[18] with Qualifier 1 and Eliminator played in Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium on 29 and 30 May, and Qualifier 2 and final played at Narendra Modi Stadium on 1 and 3 June,[19] with the venue hosting its third final after 2022 and 2023.[20] The final was played on 3 June, just a week before the 2025 ICC World Test Championship final scheduled for 11 June.[21]

Marketing
The Tata Group renewed their contract as the title sponsors of the IPL for a tenure of 5 years (2024–28) for ₹2,500 crore (US$300 million).[22] The advertising campaign for the 2025 IPL consisted of 20 sponsors and 105 advertisers[23][24] including – Dream11, Tata Motors, AngelOne, RuPay, CEAT and Wonder Cement.[25]

Broadcasting
Disney Star's Star Sports and Viacom18's JioCinema had initially acquired the satellite and digital broadcasting rights for the 2023–2027 IPL cycle respectively.[26] In November 2024, the two companies merged to form JioStar.[27] In February 2025, JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar merged to form JioHotstar, which now holds the domestic digital broadcasting rights for the remainder of the 2023–2027 cycle.[28]

In the opening weekend of three matches, Star Sports reported 253 million viewership, with a 39% increase in the average television viewership rating compared to last season, while JioHotstar reported 1.37 billion viewership, a 40% increase from last season.[29][30] The final match reported a record-breaking 169 million viewership.[31]
